## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes 911 emergency call data to uncover patterns and trends in emergency incidents.  
The dataset contains detailed information on emergency calls including location, time, and category of the call.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Explore the dataset and identify **patterns in emergency calls**.
- Analyze trends across **time dimensions** (hour, day, month).
- Compare call volumes by **emergency type** (EMS, Fire, Traffic).
- Use data visualization to present findings in a **clear and insightful way**.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Key Insights
- Seasonal and daily patterns in emergency calls.  
- Distribution of emergencies by category (Traffic, Fire, EMS).  
- Trends over time visualized with line plots and histograms.
